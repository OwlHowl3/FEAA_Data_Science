For example, a person’s gender may be male or female.\n","\n","> *Foreign-key constraints:* as in relational databases, a foreign key column can’t have a value that does not exist in the referenced primary key.\n","\n","> *Regular expression patterns:* text fields that have to be in a certain pattern. For example, phone numbers may be required to have the pattern (999) 999–9999.\n","\n","> *Cross-field validation:* certain conditions that span across multiple fields must hold. For example, a patient’s date of discharge from the hospital cannot be earlier than the date of admission.\n","\n","**Accuracy**\n","> The degree to which the data is close to the true values.\n","\n","> A valid street address mightn’t actually exist. A valid person’s eye colour, say blue, might be valid, but not true (doesn’t represent the reality).\n","Another thing to note is the difference between accuracy and precision. Saying that you live on the earth is, actually true. But, not precise. Where on the earth?. Saying that you live at a particular street address is more precise.\n","\n","**Completeness**\n","\n","> The degree to which all required data is known.\n","\n","Here’s some typical reasons why data is missing:\n","- User forgot to fill in a field.\n","- Data was lost while transferring manually from a legacy database.\n","- There was a programming error.\n","- Users chose not to fill out a field tied to their beliefs about how the results would be used or interpreted.\n","\n","**Consistency**\n","\n","> The degree to which the data is consistent, within the same data set or across multiple data sets.\n","\n","Inconsistency occurs when two values in the data set contradict each other.\n","\n","- A valid age, say 10, mightn’t match with the marital status, say divorced.\n","- A customer is recorded in two different tables with two different addresses.\n","\n","Which one is true?.\n","\n","**Uniformity**\n","\n","> The degree to which the data is specified using the same unit of measure.\n","\n","- The weight may be recorded either in pounds or kilos.\n","- The date might follow the USA format or European format.\n","- The currency is sometimes in USD and sometimes in YEN.\n","\n","And so data must be converted to a single measure
